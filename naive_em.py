# X: an (n,d) Numpy array of n data points, each with d features
# K: number of mixture components
# mu: (K,d) Numpy array where the jth row is the mean vector μ(j)
# p: (K,) Numpy array of mixing proportions πj, j=1,…,K
# var: (K,) Numpy array of variances σ2j, j=1,…,K

# The convergence criteria is that the improvement in the log-likelihood is less than or equal to 10^−6
# multiplied by the absolute value of the new log-likelihood. In slightly more algebraic notation:
# (new-log-likelihood) − (old-log-likelihood) ≤ 10^−6⋅ |new log-likelihood|

# The code will output updated versions of a GaussianMixture (with means mu, variances var and mixing proportions p)
# as well as an (n,K) Numpy array post, where post[i,j] is the posterior probability p(j|x(i)),
# and LL which is the log-likelihood of the weighted dataset.
# EM should monotonically increase the log-likelihood of the data.
# Initialize and run the EM algorithm on the toy dataset. Check that the LL values that the algorithm returns
# after each run are indeed always monotonically increasing (non-decreasing).

# Using K=3 and a seed of 0, on the toy dataset should get a log likelihood of -1388.0818 after first iteration.
